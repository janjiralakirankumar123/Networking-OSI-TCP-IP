# OSI model and the TCP/IP model with real-world examples to help you understand their practical applications.

## 1. OSI Model:

OSI Model
What Is the OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s

The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely used, as it helps visualize and communicate how networks operate, and helps isolate and troubleshoot networking problems.

OSI was introduced in 1983 by representatives of the major computer and telecom companies, and was adopted by ISO as an international standard in 1984.

OSI Model Explained: The OSI 7 Layers

**- Application Layer (Layer 7):** This layer deals with end-user applications and services.

**Real-world examples:** It include web browsers (like Google Chrome), email clients (like Microsoft Outlook), and file transfer programs (like FTP clients). 

When you launch a web browser and navigate to a website, your interaction takes place within the application layer, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. When you use your browser to connect to websites like www.example.com, you are operating within the application layer of the internet stack.

**- Presentation Layer (Layer 6):** The presentation layer handles data translation, encryption, and compression. 

**For example:** when you access a secure website (https://), the presentation layer ensures that the data transmitted between your browser and the web server is encrypted using protocols like TLS/SSL.

When you view a PDF document, the presentation layer might handle converting the raw binary data of the PDF file into a format that can be displayed on your screen with fonts, images, and formatting intact.

**- Session Layer (Layer 5):** This layer manages and establishes communication sessions. 

When you log in to a website or an online service, a session is created to keep track of your interactions. If you log out or your session expires, the session layer is involved in managing that process.

When you log in to an online banking website and start a session to check your account balance, the session layer keeps track of your interactions during that session.

**- Transport Layer (Layer 4):** The transport layer ensures reliable end-to-end data delivery. 

A real-world example is when you download a file using the FTP (File Transfer Protocol). The transport layer (e.g., TCP) ensures that the file is divided into packets, sent to your computer, and reassembled correctly.

Consider a file download via FTP. The transport layer ensures that the file is divided into packets, transmitted reliably, and reassembled correctly on your computer.

**- Network Layer (Layer 3):** The network layer handles routing and forwarding of data between different networks or subnets. 

When you access a website hosted on a server in another country, routers in the network layer help direct your data across the internet to reach its destination.

Imagine you're sending an email from your computer in New York to a friend in Los Angeles. The network layer helps route your email packets through routers and switches across the internet to reach your friend's email server.

**- Data Link Layer (Layer 2):** This layer deals with data framing and addressing on a local network. 

An example is when you connect to the internet via Wi-Fi. The data link layer (e.g., Ethernet) manages how data is sent over your local network, ensuring that devices on the same network can communicate.

Think about connecting your computer to a local network using an Ethernet cable. The data link layer manages how your data is framed and sent over the physical Ethernet medium, ensuring that your computer can communicate with other devices on the same network.

**- Physical Layer (Layer 1):** The physical layer involves the actual hardware and transmission of data. 

When you plug an Ethernet cable into your computer, the physical layer manages the electrical signals that transmit data between your device and the network switch or router.

The physical layer involves the actual cables, connectors, and electronic signals used for data transmission. For example, it includes the electrical voltages that represent 0s and 1s over an Ethernet cable when you send data.

**2. TCP/IP Model:**

**- Application Layer:** This layer corresponds to the applications and services that you use over the internet. 

For example, web browsers (HTTP), email (SMTP), and remote login (SSH) are applications that operate at this layer.

Consider using a web browser like Chrome to access a website (e.g., www.google.com). The application layer is where your browser interacts with the website and displays its content.

**- Transport Layer:** The transport layer includes the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 

When you send an email, TCP ensures that your email is reliably delivered, while UDP might be used for real-time video streaming where some data loss is acceptable.

When you make an online purchase and enter your credit card details on a shopping website, the transport layer ensures that your payment information is securely transmitted to the server using HTTPS (which relies on TCP).

**- Internet Layer:** This layer is responsible for routing packets of data between different networks or across the internet. 

Internet Protocol (IP) operates here. When you send data from your computer to a server in another country, routers in the internet layer help it reach its destination.

Imagine you're streaming a video on YouTube. The internet layer, specifically the Internet Protocol (IP), helps route the video data packets across various networks and routers to reach your device.

**- Link Layer (Network Access Layer):** This layer encompasses both the data link and physical layers of the OSI model. 

Real-world examples include Ethernet for wired connections and Wi-Fi for wireless connections. When you connect to a Wi-Fi network, the link layer manages the wireless transmission of data.

When you connect your smartphone to a Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop, the link layer manages the wireless transmission of data between your device and the Wi-Fi access point.

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of seven layers, each with its own set of protocols. Here are the protocols typically associated with each layer of the OSI model:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**:
